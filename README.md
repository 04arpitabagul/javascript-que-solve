# Practical Exam

### 1. JavaScript Introduction

1. **Write a script to display "Hello, World!" in the browser console.**
2. **Create a JavaScript function that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.**

### 2. EcmaScript

1. **Create a `const` variable and try to change its value. What happens?**

### 3. Variable Declaration

1. **Declare a variable using `var`, `let`, and `const`. Show the scope differences by logging them inside and outside of a block (`if` or `for` loop).**
2. **Create a variable, initialize it with a number, and then update it to a string. Show that JavaScript allows dynamic typing.**

### 4. Rules of Variable Declaration

1. **Write code that declares a variable with an invalid name (e.g., starting with a number). What error is produced? Fix it.**
2. **Write a script that declares a global variable and a local variable inside a function. Log both variables from inside and outside the function to show scope differences.**

### 5. Difference Between Let, Var, Const

1. **Write a function that demonstrates the difference between `var` and `let` inside a loop. Show how `var` causes hoisting issues.**
2. **Create a constant object and attempt to change one of its properties. What happens? Demonstrate how `const` works with objects.**

### 6. Template Literals

1. **Create a template literal that embeds variables in a string and includes a multi-line string.**
2. **Use a template literal to dynamically construct a sentence that includes the results of a mathematical expression (e.g., 5 + 3).**

### 7. Types of Operators

1. **Write a program that takes two numbers and performs all arithmetic operations on them (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus). Log the results.**
2. **Demonstrate the difference between `==` and `===` operators by comparing two variables with different data types (e.g., a number and a string).**

### 8. Ternary Operators

1. **Write a function that checks if a number is even or odd using a ternary operator.**
2. **Convert a traditional `if-else` statement that checks if a person can vote (age >= 18) into a ternary operator.**

### 9. Conditional Statements

1. **Write a script that takes a number as input and logs whether it is positive, negative, or zero using `if-else` statements.**
2. **Create a program that checks the current day of the week using a `switch` statement and logs whether it is a weekday or a weekend.**

### 10. Loops

1. **Write a `for` loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 10.**
2. **Write a `while` loop that sums the numbers from 1 to 100.**
3. **Write a `do-while` loop that keeps prompting the user for input until they enter a number greater than 10.**
4. **Create a program that uses a `for` loop to iterate over an array of numbers and prints only the even numbers using `continue`.**

### 11. Strings

1. **Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string in reverse order.**
2. **Write a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome (a word that reads the same forwards and backwards).**
3. **Create a function that counts the number of vowels in a given string.**

### 12. Combining Multiple Topics

1. **Write a function that takes an array of strings, loops through them, and returns a new array containing only the strings that have more than 5 characters.**
2. **Create a function that generates a random number between 1 and 100. If the number is even, log "Even"; if it's odd, log "Odd". Use a combination of `if-else` and the modulus operator.**
